#AITA MODELS
This repos is for creating the database models for storing scraped data from the subreddit 'Am I the Asshole'
(A subreddit where users provide a situation and ask the question if they were in the wrong.)

This repo contains all the code needed for running the database locally.

## Using AITA-Models
Before running, ensure that you have the necessary tools installed:
1. Docker Desktop
2. A .ENV file filled out similar to the template

To run the package, run: \
```make run``` \
From the root directory. You can view the database using Adminer by going to: \
```localhost:8080``` in a web browser.
